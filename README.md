# Drupal Navigation Config

This is a custom Drupal module that lets you select between two different navigation styles in the CMS. The type of navigation can be set here: /admin/config/nav-settings. This adds a class that you can style the two different menus for. 

## Menu Options
- Hamburger
- Basic Navigation
